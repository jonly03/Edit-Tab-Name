## How to clone the repo

To clone this repo (or to download the files that make it up), you will need a tool called `git`.

The easiest way is through your computer's terminal/shell interface. Macs come packaged with git already. Windows need to install a tool called `git bash`.

With `git` installed, type the following inside of the computer's terminal:

If using HTTPS (username + password to talk to Github), type `git clone https://github.com/jonly03/Edit-Tab-Name.git`

If using SSH (cryptographic keys to talk to Github), type `git@github.com:jonly03/Edit-Tab-Name.git`
